This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

[Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) components are being implemented.

Below are the Components used:

App Bar, Drawer, Table, Material Icons

This app is just a simple project tom implement the basic concepts of [React JS](https://facebook.github.io/react/). From using JSX and conditionally rendering react elements to Lifting the state up to handle the logic in the parent components and enable communication among children components.
